Miscellaneous Synth DIY projects


## POW IDC cap
The "POW CAP" is a 3D-printed plastic cap for a 16-pin IDC socket in the POW-module designed by Kristian Blåsol aka Sourcery. I created two versions with and without holes for adding an extra wire to your module. See folder for .step and stl files.

Without holes:

Kristian Blåsol is one of my synth DIY goeroes and I got honour to help him with designing this little helper in 3D. If you wish to start with building your own synth modules please visit his incredible Youtube series [Modular In A Week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DKU1m5_b_8&list=PLyE56WXw0_5Q5QGMEXWmskuhojKyRdA3T). It will at least inspire you as it did with me and got me started with this hobby! Thanx for all that Kristian!
