# Wavefolder

This Project contains the Buchla Wavefolder redesigned by Non Lineair circuits. I redesigned the complete pcb design for through hole

## buildnotes
* Please check the BOM files. This design doesn't use the smd BC857 but a through hole 2n3906 instead
* The J112 can be sourced at tayda. See A-3967
* Some tracks are only 0.5mm, so you need to be sure your toner transfer is decent.
