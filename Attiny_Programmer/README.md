  * Heartbeat. Shows that the programmer is live.
  * Programming. Lights up while programming the Attiny's.
  * Error. Lights up when the programmer hits an issue.
* Breadboard helpers. These little sub-boards let you connect your Attiny directly with a breadboard for testing your new program, so you don't need to constantly swap your Attiny between your prototype and the programmer.
* Power jumper. Quickly set the power supply for the Attiny's: from USB or from Breadboard.
* A buildin testing LED for your blinking test program. This can also be disconnected completely with a jumper.

## Files
