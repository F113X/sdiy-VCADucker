This module helps your kickdrum to push through a bussy mix with a technique called "ducking", ideal for techno music. For this the module requires you to insert your kickdrum and separately your main audiomix. The module converts then the kickdrum-audio into an envelope-cv, also called an "envelope-follower". That envelope pushes the volume of the main mix down when you hear the kick. With this the kickdrum simply gets all the space it needs when its is represented instead of getting overpowered by all the other audio signals.




## Features

This module has a few options to create and adjust control-voltages for the VCA (voltage controlled amplifier).
* Convert an audio signal into an 'envelope follower' or 'AD envelope'.
  * An AD envelope (attack-decay) is not affected by the sustain of a signal as is with the envelope follower. This ideal if you like to create shorter envelopes.
* Alternatively convert an external gate signal into an AD envelope.
* Change the decay of the envelope signal.
* Use that envelope to increase (standard VCA operation) or decrease (Ducking operation) the main signal.
  * For this an attenuverter is present that changes the incomming (envelope) cv.
  * This means instead of using a kickdrum to control a signal you can also use a gate signal with the build in envelope generator to control any (audio) signal.
* Alternatively use any external cv source to control the VCA.

Other 
* Mix the kickdrum together with the main signal with a dedicated knob.
* Toggle between 'kickdrum + main signal mix', 'solo kickdrum', or 'solo main signal'.
