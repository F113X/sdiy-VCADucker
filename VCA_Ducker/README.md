This module helps your kickdrum to push through a bussy mix with a technique called "ducking", ideal for techno music. For this the module requires you to insert your kickdrum and separately your main audiomix. The module converts then the kickdrum-audio into an envelope-cv, also called an "envelope-follower". That envelope pushes the volume of the main mix down when you hear the kick. With this the kickdrum simply gets all the space it needs when its is represented instead of getting overpowered by all the other audio signals.


## Features

* Convert an audio signal into an envelope follower.
* Convert an audio signal into an AD envelope to get more control
  * An AD (attack-decay) envelope is not affected by the sustain of a signal as is with the envelope follower. Ideal for shorter envelopes.
* Convert an gate into an AD envelope.
* Choose between the envelope follower or an AD envelope.
* Use that envelope to increase (standard VCA) or decrease (Ducking).
  * For this an attenuverter is present that changes the incomming (envelope) cv. 
* Use any external cv to control the VCA.
* Mix the kickdrum together with the main signal with a dedicated knob.
