# DUAL Low Pass Gate with integrated "envelope"
This vactrol based module converts any sound into a drum sound.

## Features
- Inputs:
  - Gate Input.
  - Signal Input.
- Outputs:
-   Short and natural "feeling" (due to vactrols) drum sound.
-   A very short trigger useful for combining with external VCA's etc.
- Two channels. each channel has a simple switch for changing the decay length.

## How It Works
The gate signal is converted into a very fast trigger which open and closes the vactrol by lighting its inner LED. Due to the capacitors near the vactrols and the vactrol itself that trigger is converted into more natrual slopy decay. Furthermore the vactrols filter out higher frequencies while closing. Giving it a "natural" sounding effect.


## Build Notes
- Just use some heatshrink tubing (maybe use the ones with glue as I did) to bundle a LDR and a white LED. See Youtube for tips on this topic.
- Experiment with different capacitors for the decays. I used fairly modest values but you can get creative with it. Please note that higher values will not a close the signal that well but can create an interesting effect anyway.

ps. I will add some better looking labels ;)
