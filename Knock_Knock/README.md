Knock Knock is a simple to use, 6HP wide, but powerfull 5 channel euclidian rhythm generator for creating interesting patterns on the fly.

1. Play button.
2. Division button.
3. Length button.
4. Shift button.
5. Clock button.
6. Clock input jack.
7. Five output jacks.
8. Rotary encoder and button.
9. LED bar.

## Basic Operation.
As a starter Knock Knock has its own internal clock, so you don't need to feed it any external clock pulses. If the module runs you will see in the LED bar (9) the ON-steps, and the current position of the pattern moving downwards. The ON-steps are visualised with a lower LED brightness,  and the current position is visualised with a higher LED brightness. To start or stop the rythm simply press the Plat button (1).

To change the pattern of your active channel you can do the following:
1. Turn the rotary encoder (8) (without pressing any other button) left or right to decrease or increase the amounth of ON-steps in the pattern.
2. Press the division button (2) and rotate the encoder (9) to change the clock division. Completely up is the fastest and has no division. Going downward it is /2, /4, /8, /16, /32, /64 etc .
3. Press the length button (3) and rotate the encoder (9) to change the length of the pattern. 
4. Press the shift button (4) and rotate the encoder (9) to to move the pattern up or down.

While pressing any of these buttons you see the current state of that parameter visualised in the LED bar.
