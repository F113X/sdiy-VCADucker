This project is a perfboard design of the famous Moog Tranistsor Ladder Filter by Kassutronics. If you look online you will find many ever so slightly different versions of Moog's ladder filter. I used Kassutronics one, since most of his designs are pretty good. See his [documentation](https://kassu2000.blogspot.com/2018/07/transistor-ladder-filter.html) for more info. 

You will have to match transistors for this project. [See here about how to](https://kassu2000.blogspot.com/2015/10/transistor-matching.html). It will require maybe an hour of your time. But it is not difficult at all, and oh wow I really love this filter! If you are SDIY enthusiast this one is a must have!

## Do you see the 'ladder' ?
