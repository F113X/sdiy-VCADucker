# MS_20_VCF_Clone

This VCF is a must have for every Synth DIY nerd! It is a realtive simple build, but very powerful.
I didn't changed the original clone from Rene Schmitz actually, but I had some trouble at first reading his low res schematic, and I also wanted to utilize the high-pass as described in his text. 

Therefore I did this redrawn. See original: https://www.schmitzbits.de/ms20.html
