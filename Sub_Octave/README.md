# Sub Octave Generator
This module creates a square wave sub octave for your DIY synthesizer. It is a simple means to create a two tone chord without adding another complex VCO. I personally use it often to create really fat sounds. 

## Features
* Select the sub chord with a rotary switch: -1,-2,-3,-4,-5,-6,-7.
* Transform each waveform into a square wave.
* Mix the sub chord with that square wave version.
