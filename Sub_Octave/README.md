# Sub Octave Generator
This module creates a square wave sub octave for your DIY synthesizer. It is a means to create a simple chord without adding another complex VCO. I personally use it often to create really fat sounds.

## Features
* Select the sub division with a rotary switch: /2, /4, /8, /16, /32, /64, /128.
* Mix the sub division with a square wave version of your original frequency.
* Extra compare knob.
