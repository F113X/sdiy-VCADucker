Alter Normal is a 40106 based analog hi-hat with lots of extra's to create a new palette of ischh and osshhh.

## Features
* Voltage controlled envelope generator (decay).
* Decay and shape control over the envelope.
* A full fetched state variable filter with high, band and low pass filters.
* Pan between metallic and white noise.
* Three trigger modes:
  * Single; prevents a retrigger during cycle.
  * Retrig; default mode. All incomming triggers restart the envelope generator.
  * Loop; looping hi-hats!! In this mode a high gate on the trigger input will hold the loop.
* Sample & Hold.
  * Decay CV will be hold until next trigger input.
  * Internal noise is used to randomly adjust the CV. This via normalisation of the CV jacks.
