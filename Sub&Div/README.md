# SUB & DIV

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PierreIsCoding/sdiy/main/Sub%26Div/images/explain.png" width="250" />

SUB & DIV is a 6HP wide sub octave generator and clock divider with CV.

## Manual
1. Sub oscillator mix knob.
2. Division selection and bias knob.
3. Input CV attenuator.
4. Selected division.
5. CV input jack.
6. Oscillator input jack.
7. Mixer output jack.
8. Clock output jack.
9. Clock reset button.

## Sub Octave Generator.
With SUB & DIV you can beef up your vco signals with an sub octaves. A sub octave is technically a clock division and musically an octave lower or more than your original singal. To use the module as a sub octave generator:

* Insert a vco signal into the OSC input jack (6).
* Listen to the MIX output (7).
* Crossfade between your inserted signal and sub octave with the Sub oscillator mix knob (1).
* Change the selected division with the DIV knob (2).

SUB & DIV allows you to select 4 divisions/ sub octaves. The selected one is visualised with the 4 leds.

## Clock Division.
The clock division is quite similar to the sub octave generation, however you would normally use slower signal into the OSC in. To use the module as a clock divider:

* Insert an LFO or any clock source into the OSC input jack (6).
* Connect external modules like drum sounds to the DIV output jack (8).
* The sub mix knob (1) has no effect on this ouput.
* Change the selected division with the DIV knob (2).
* To restart the counting at zero press the reset button (9). 

The four leds (4) also change brightness at the speed of the clock division. You won't notice this for fast clocks like your VCO, but for slower you will.

## CV
The main trick of this module is CV! With that you can change the selected clock division / sub octave.
* Insert a cv into the CV input jack (5).
* Attenuate this CV signal (3).
* Bias this CV signal with the DIV knob (2).

That's all! Have fun.
