This design is a simple lightweight skiff case for Eurorack.

## Create Alu Back Plate
- I used some 1mm waste ALU plate. You can cut these aluminium with a stanley knive. Just scratch both sides a few times with your knive. If you bend one side repeatedly while holding the other firmly on the edge of a table you can break it off after a short while.
- Bending without breaking is a bit more difficult. See image. I used two damp towels for more grip and a strong piece of wood to bend it all. I bended the side with a soft hamer and pushing and pulling manually.
- Idea: use some strong cardboard instead.

## Combine the wooden "eurorack rails" with some panels
- Use a few panels and screw here those slats. This ensures you your modules should fit.

## Create the mounting sides
- Create those mounting sides and check with the previous step if the rails with panels tightly fit

## Fix the assembly
- Add the aluminium back panel and adjust the dimensions if needed.
- Use small wood screws between the wooden "rails" and the back panel
- Use larger wood screws between the mounting sides and the back panel

## Finishing
- Add decorating side panels, with wood glue. I used some varnish on them

- Add 3D printed front panels. These panels are just for decoration, but it will make it look much better

## Final
I used the "Behringer System 55 CP1A" for power. Have Fun !
