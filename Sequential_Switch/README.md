## Features
* 4 step analog sequencer with scale potentiometer.
* 4 step sequential switch that routes four audio or cv signals to one single output.
* A clock input for counting up the steps.
* Selectable step length: 2,4,3 steps.
* 4 buttons for manually selecting each step.
* A gate output that combines the clock input with the manual gates given by the buttons.
* Whenever a button is pressed the clock input is disabled.

## How to use it (examples)
* Automatically switch between different analog sequencers.
* Automatically switch between different CV sources like a fast LFO, a slow LFO, and an envelope generator.
* Build complex sounds by quickly looping between differnt VCO shapes comming from a [CEM3340 VCO](https://github.com/PierreIsCoding/sdiy/tree/main/CEM3340_VCO).
* Build complex rhythms by switching between different simple gate patterns.
* Switch quickly between different audio sources during a performance with the manual buttons.
* Create four different drum sounds and play them manually with the manual gate output into clock of my [Low Pass Gate](https://github.com/PierreIsCoding/sdiy/tree/main/LPG) and the CV out into the pitch control of a VCO into that same LPG.
* Create random colored hihats by using four different noise sources and switch between with my [Probability gate](https://github.com/PierreIsCoding/sdiy/tree/main/Probability_Gate).

## Build notes
* This a fairly difficult project.
* If you etch this project on a single layer connect the back layer with wires and see below for the header soldering.
