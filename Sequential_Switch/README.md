## Features
* 4 step analog sequencer with scale potentiometer.
* 4 step sequential switch that routes for audio or cv signals to a single output.
* A clock input for sequencing the steps.
* 4 buttons for manually selecting each step.
* A gate output that combines the clock input with the manual gates given by the buttons.
* Whenever a button is pressed the clock input is disabled.

## Build notes
* This a fairly difficult project.
* If you etch this project on a single layer connect the back layer with wires and see below for the header soldering.
